Turn messy, monolithic Laravel services into clean, testable, observable pipelines. Sentinels transforms your 300-line service classes into focused agents that you can compose, test, and debug with surgical precision. When something breaks at 3 AM, you'll know exactly which step failed and why.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or later, including PHP 8.5.
- Laravel 9–13. Laravel 11 and 12 require PHP 8.2 or later; Laravel 13 requires PHP 8.3 or later.

### Laravel 13 async cache configuration

Laravel 13 applications disable cache object unserialization by default. Async pipelines cache `Context` objects, so add this class to the `serializable_classes` allowlist in your application's `config/cache.php`:

```php
'serializable_classes' => [
    \Vampires\Sentinels\Core\Context::class,
],
```

Merge this with any existing allowlist and include any object classes intentionally stored in your pipeline payload or metadata. Keep the allowlist explicit. Rebuild cached configuration and restart queue workers after changing it.

## ⚡ See the Difference Immediately

```php
// 😰 Before: One massive, untestable method
class OrderService {
    public function processOrder($order) {
        // 200+ lines of mixed concerns that all live in your head
        $this->validateInventory($order);    // What if this fails?
        $this->processPayment($order);       // Where's the logging?
        $this->updateInventory($order);      // How do you test this?
        $this->sendNotifications($order);    // Why did this break?
        $this->updateAnalytics($order);      // Good luck debugging!
        // When it breaks, where do you even start looking?
    }
}

// 🚀 After: Clean, testable, traceable pipeline
$result = Sentinels::pipeline()
    ->pipe(new ValidateInventoryAgent())    // ✅ Single responsibility
    ->pipe(new ProcessPaymentAgent())       // ✅ Individual error handling  
    ->pipe(new UpdateInventoryAgent())      // ✅ Easy to test in isolation
    ->pipe(new SendNotificationAgent())     // ✅ Automatic correlation IDs
    ->pipe(new UpdateAnalyticsAgent())      // ✅ Built-in performance metrics
    ->through($order);
// Every step is logged, timed, and traceable. Debug like a detective. 🕵️‍♂️
```

## ⚡ Queued Async Execution

Dispatch parallel work through Laravel queues, then explicitly retrieve the completed context:

```php
$pending = Sentinels::pipeline()
    ->mode('parallel')
    ->async()
    ->pipe(new ApiCallAgent())
    ->pipe(new DatabaseAgent())
    ->pipe(new EmailServiceAgent())
    ->through($data);

echo "Progress: " . $pending->getProgress() . "%";
$result = $pending->result(timeout: 60); // wait() also returns the completed Context
$payload = $result->payload;
```

The pending handle's public properties contain the original submission. Use the context returned by `result()` or `wait()` for completed payloads, metadata, and errors. Configure queue workers, batch storage, and a shared cache as described in [the pipeline guide](docs/pipelines.md#asynchronous-pipeline-execution).

## 🎯 Why Laravel Developers Need Sentinels

**The Problem:** Your services are becoming monsters. A simple "process order" method somehow became 300 lines of tangled logic. Testing is a nightmare. Debugging production issues feels like archaeology. Sound familiar?

**The Solution:** Break complex workflows into focused agents that do one thing brilliantly. Get observability, error recovery, and conditional logic for free.

```php
// Instead of this monolithic service...
class OrderProcessor 
{
    public function process($order) {
        $this->validateOrder($order);
        $this->checkInventory($order);  
        $this->processPayment($order);
        $this->sendNotification($order);
        // 200+ lines of tightly coupled logic...
    }
}

// You get this clean, testable pipeline...
$result = Sentinels::pipeline()
    ->pipe(new ValidateOrderAgent())
    ->pipe(new CheckInventoryAgent())
    ->pipe(new ProcessPaymentAgent())
    ->pipe(new SendNotificationAgent())
    ->through($order);
```

### What Makes It Different
- **Debug Like a Detective**: Every request gets a correlation ID that traces through your entire pipeline
- **Test with Confidence**: Each agent is isolated, focused, and easy to mock
- **Scale Intelligently**: Route tasks based on content, not just linear execution
- **Stay in Laravel**: Built specifically for Laravel's patterns and ecosystem

## 🚀 Get Running in 2 Minutes

### Installation
```bash
composer require vampires/sentinels
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=sentinels-config
```

### Your First Agent
```bash
# Generate your agent
php artisan make:agent ProcessOrderAgent

# It creates this focused class
class ProcessOrderAgent extends BaseAgent
{
    protected function handle(Context $context): Context
    {
        $order = $context->payload;
        
        // Do your processing here
        $processedOrder = $this->processOrder($order);
        
        return $context->with($processedOrder);
    }
}
```

### Use It Immediately
```php
// Simple processing
$result = Sentinels::process($order, new ProcessOrderAgent());

// Or build a pipeline  
$result = Sentinels::pipeline()
    ->pipe(new ValidateOrderAgent())
    ->pipe(new ProcessOrderAgent()) 
    ->pipe(new SendEmailAgent())
    ->through($order);

// That's it! Every step is now logged, timed, and traceable. 🎉
```

## 🔧 The 3 Core Problems Sentinels Eliminates

### 1. 😰 "The Service From Hell" Problem
```php
// ❌ The 500-line service method that haunts your dreams
class OrderService {
    public function processOrder($order) {
        // 🔥 This method has EVERYTHING:
        $this->validateStuff($order);      // 50 lines of validation
        $this->chargePayment($order);      // 75 lines of payment logic  
        $this->doShipping($order);         // 40 lines of shipping
        $this->sendEmails($order);         // 60 lines of notifications
        $this->updateAnalytics($order);    // 35 lines of tracking
        // Testing this? Good luck. Debugging? Therapy time. 😵‍💫
    }
}

// ✅ Clean, focused, debuggable pipeline
$result = Sentinels::pipeline()
    ->pipe(new ValidateOrderAgent())       // ✅ 25 lines, one job
    ->pipe(new ChargePaymentAgent())       // ✅ Testable in isolation  
    ->pipe(new HandleShippingAgent())      // ✅ Mock external APIs easily
    ->pipe(new SendNotificationAgent())    // ✅ Individual error handling
    ->pipe(new TrackAnalyticsAgent())      // ✅ Single responsibility
    ->through($order);
// Each step is focused, testable, and debuggable. Your future self will thank you. 🙏
```

### 2. 🕵️‍♀️ "The 3 AM Debugging Mystery" Problem
```php
// ❌ Production breaks at 3 AM. The log says:
Log::error("Something broke in order processing");

// 😰 Which of the 15 steps failed? What data caused it? 
// Where do you even start looking? Time to wake up the entire team...

// ✅ Sentinels gives you DETECTIVE-LEVEL debugging:
// Every request gets a correlation ID that traces through EVERYTHING:

[2024-01-15 03:07:43] INFO: Agent starting
  • agent: ValidateOrderAgent  
  • correlation_id: req_789abc123
  • user_id: 12345
  • input_state: {...}

[2024-01-15 03:07:44] ERROR: Agent failed  
  • agent: ProcessPaymentAgent ⬅️ FOUND THE CULPRIT!
  • correlation_id: req_789abc123
  • error: "Card declined: insufficient funds"
  • execution_time: 1.2s

// Now you know EXACTLY what broke, for which user, and why. 
// Fix it in 5 minutes instead of 2 hours. 😎
```

### 3. 🔄 "The Copy-Paste Workflow" Problem
```php
// ❌ You have similar workflows everywhere, but they're all different:
class BlogProcessor {
    public function process($post) {
        $this->validateContent($post);    // 30 lines of validation
        $this->optimizeImages($post);     // 45 lines of image processing  
        $this->generateSEO($post);        // 25 lines of SEO logic
    }
}

class ProductProcessor {  
    public function process($product) {
        $this->validateContent($product);  // Copy-pasted (but slightly different)
        $this->optimizeImages($product);   // Copy-pasted (with bugs)
        $this->generateSEO($product);      // Copy-pasted (missing features)
    }
}
// Result: 6 different validation methods. When you fix a bug, you fix it in 6 places. 😭

// ✅ Write once, reuse everywhere:
$contentPipeline = [
    new ValidateContentAgent(),    // Works for ANY content
    new OptimizeImagesAgent(),     // Handles all image types
    new GenerateSEOAgent(),        // SEO for everything
];

// Same agents, different contexts
$blogResult = Sentinels::pipeline()->pipes($contentPipeline)->through($blogPost);
$productResult = Sentinels::pipeline()->pipes($contentPipeline)->through($product);
$pageResult = Sentinels::pipeline()->pipes($contentPipeline)->through($landingPage);

// One bug fix updates EVERYWHERE. One improvement benefits ALL workflows. 🎉
```

These are the core pain points that drive developers to Sentinels. But what makes Sentinels different from other solutions?

## 🚀 Why Sentinels Will Transform Your Workflow

- **🕵️‍♀️ Debug Like a Detective**: Every request gets a correlation ID that follows it through your entire pipeline. When something breaks, you'll know exactly which agent failed, for which user, and why. No more mysterious exceptions!

- **🎯 Write Agents, Not Services**: Each agent does ONE thing brilliantly. 50 lines instead of 500. Test in isolation. Mock with confidence. Your code reviews will thank you.

- **🚦 Smart Routing That Actually Works**: Route based on content, not just sequence. Premium users get the VIP pipeline. Failed payments get the retry flow. Same codebase, intelligent decisions.

- **⚡ Queued Async Execution**: Dispatch with `->mode('parallel')->async()`, monitor progress, and retrieve completed results with `->result()`.

- **📊 Production Insights for Free**: Built-in metrics, performance tracking, and error correlation. See which agents are slow, which fail most, and optimize based on real data.

- **🛠️ Laravel Developer Experience**: `make:agent`, `make:pipeline`, built-in testing helpers, facade support. Feels native because it is native.

- **🔀 Conditional Logic That Makes Sense**: Branch, merge, loop, and compose pipelines. Handle complex business logic without drowning in if-statements.

- **⚙️ Laravel Integration**: Works with your service container, events, middleware, and queues. Queued pipelines require workers, batch storage, and shared cache configuration; see [async setup](docs/pipelines.md#configuration).

Sounds interesting? Here are the types of problems Sentinels is designed to solve:

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

Here are the most compelling ways you could use Sentinels to transform your complex workflows:

### 🤖 AI/LLM Pipeline Processing
```php
// Process user input through multiple AI analysis steps
$result = Sentinels::pipeline()
    ->pipe(new ContentModerationAgent())      // Check for harmful content
    ->pipe(new LanguageDetectionAgent())      // Detect input language  
    ->pipe(new IntentClassificationAgent())   // Classify user intent
    ->pipe(new ResponseGenerationAgent())     // Generate appropriate response
    ->pipe(new QualityAssuranceAgent())       // Validate response quality
    ->through($userMessage);
```

### 📧 Multi-Channel Notification System
```php
// Send notifications to multiple channels in parallel
$result = Sentinels::pipeline()
    ->mode('parallel')
    ->async()                                 // 👈 True parallel delivery!
    ->pipe(new EmailNotificationAgent())     // Send email
    ->pipe(new SMSNotificationAgent())       // Send SMS  
    ->pipe(new PushNotificationAgent())      // Send push notification
    ->pipe(new SlackNotificationAgent())     // Send to Slack
    ->through($notificationRequest);

// Wait for all channels and retrieve the aggregated Context
$result = $result->result();
echo "Notifications sent: " . count($result->payload);
echo "Delivery rate: " . $result->getSuccessRate() . "%";
```

### 📊 ETL Data Processing
```php
// Transform data through validation, enrichment, and normalization
Sentinels::pipeline()
    ->pipe(new DataValidationAgent())         // Validate incoming data structure
    ->pipe(new DuplicationDetectionAgent())   // Remove or flag duplicates
    ->pipe(new DataEnrichmentAgent())         // Add external data (geo, demographics)
    ->pipe(new NormalizationAgent())          // Standardize formats and units
    ->pipe(new QualityScoreAgent())           // Assign data quality scores
    ->pipe(new DatabaseInsertAgent())         // Persist to appropriate tables
    ->through($rawDataBatch);
```

### 🛒 E-commerce Order Processing
```php
// Process order validation steps in parallel for faster checkout
$orderResult = Sentinels::pipeline()
    ->mode('parallel')
    ->async()                                 // 👈 Parallel validation
    ->pipe(new InventoryCheckAgent())        // Check stock availability
    ->pipe(new PaymentValidationAgent())     // Validate payment method
    ->pipe(new FraudDetectionAgent())        // Run fraud analysis
    ->pipe(new TaxCalculationAgent())        // Calculate taxes
    ->through($orderData);

// Retrieve completed validation results before checking errors
$orderResult = $orderResult->result();
if ($orderResult->hasErrors()) {
    return $orderResult->errors;             // Show validation failures
}

// Continue with fulfillment after validation passes
$fulfillmentResult = Sentinels::pipeline()
    ->pipe(new PaymentProcessingAgent())     // Process payment
    ->pipe(new InventoryAllocationAgent())   // Reserve inventory
    ->pipe(new ShippingLabelAgent())         // Generate shipping
    ->through($orderResult->payload);

echo "Order processed in " . $orderResult->getElapsedTime() . " seconds";
```

**Why These Patterns Work So Well:**
- **🔍 Pinpoint Failures**: When step 3 of 8 fails, you know immediately which agent and why
- **🧪 Test with Confidence**: Mock external APIs, test edge cases, verify each step independently  
- **🔀 Handle Complexity**: Premium customers? VIP pipeline. Failed payment? Retry flow. Same codebase.
- **⚡ Queued Async**: Dispatch parallel work with `->async()` and retrieve the completed context with `->result()`.
- **📊 Progressive Monitoring**: Simple by default, detailed batch statistics available for power users and ops teams

    public function test_all_agents_have_tests()
    {
        $agents = glob('app/Agents/**/*Agent.php');
        
        foreach ($agents as $agentFile) {
            $testFile = str_replace('app/', 'tests/Unit/', $agentFile);
            $testFile = str_replace('.php', 'Test.php', $testFile);
            
            $this->assertFileExists($testFile, 
                "Missing test for {$agentFile}");
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Architecture Evolution**

- Evolve to **distributed systems** using same patterns

### 📊 Expected Benefits

The agent-based architecture pattern is designed to deliver:
- **Faster debugging** through correlation tracing and isolated failures
- **Accelerated development** with focused, testable components
- **Higher test coverage** achieved through isolated units
- **Fewer production incidents** from better error isolation and recovery
- **Easier onboarding** with clear, single-purpose components

## 🛠 Installation

Install Sentinels via Composer:

```bash
composer require vampires/sentinels
```

Publish the configuration file (optional):

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=sentinels-config
```


## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Context-First Architecture

Everything in Sentinels revolves around the **Context** object - an immutable container that carries your data and metadata through the entire pipeline:

```php
// Context is immutable - each operation returns a new instance
$original = Context::create('data');
$modified = $original->with('new data');
$withMeta = $modified->withMetadata('key', 'value');

// Rich metadata support
$context = $context
    ->withTag('processed')
    ->withCorrelationId('req-123')
    ->withTraceId('trace-456');
```

### Agent Lifecycle

Agents have a rich lifecycle with hooks for custom behavior:

```php
class MyAgent extends BaseAgent
{
    protected function beforeExecute(Context $context): Context
    {
        // Setup, logging, authentication
        return $context->withMetadata('started_at', now());
    }

    protected function handle(Context $context): Context
    {
        // Your main logic here
        return $context->with($processedData);
    }

    protected function afterExecute(Context $original, Context $result): Context
    {
        // Cleanup, metrics, post-processing
        return $result->withMetadata('completed_at', now());
    }

    protected function onError(Context $context, \Throwable $exception): Context
    {
        // Error handling and recovery
        return $context->addError($exception->getMessage());
    }
}
```

### Pipeline Modes

Sentinels supports multiple execution modes:

```php
// Sequential (default)
$pipeline->mode('sequential')->pipe($agent1)->pipe($agent2);

// Parallel execution
$pipeline->mode('parallel')->pipe($agent1)->pipe($agent2);

// Map/Reduce for collections
$pipeline->mode('map_reduce')->pipe($transformAgent);

// Conditional branching
$pipeline->branch(
    fn($ctx) => $ctx->hasTag('special'),
    $specialPipeline,
    $normalPipeline
);
```

## 📚 Advanced Usage

### Dynamic Routing

Route contexts to different agents based on content:

```php
use Vampires\Sentinels\Contracts\RouterContract;

$router = app(RouterContract::class);

// Route based on payload type
$router->addTypeRoute('string', new StringProcessor());
$router->addTypeRoute('array', new ArrayProcessor());

// Route based on content patterns
$router->addPatternRoute('/^email:/', new EmailAgent());
$router->addPatternRoute('/^sms:/', new SmsAgent());

// Route based on metadata
$router->addMetadataRoute('type', 'urgent', new UrgentProcessor());
```

### Error Handling & Retries

```php
use Vampires\Sentinels\Core\RetryPolicy;

class ResilientAgent extends BaseAgent
{
    public function getRetryPolicy(): RetryPolicy
    {
        return RetryPolicy::exponential(
            attempts: 3,
            baseDelay: 1000,
            maxDelay: 10000
        );
    }
    
    protected function handle(Context $context): Context
    {
        // This will retry with exponential backoff on failure
        return $context->with($this->callExternalAPI());
    }
}
```

### Pipeline Events & Observability

```php
use Vampires\Sentinels\Events\AgentStarted;
use Vampires\Sentinels\Events\PipelineCompleted;

// Listen to agent execution events
Event::listen(AgentStarted::class, function ($event) {
    Log::info('Agent started', [
        'agent' => $event->agentName,
        'correlation_id' => $event->getCorrelationId(),
        'trace_id' => $event->getTraceId(),
    ]);
});

// Monitor pipeline completion
Event::listen(PipelineCompleted::class, function ($event) {
    Metrics::timing('pipeline.duration', $event->getExecutionTime());
});
```

### Testing

Sentinels provides comprehensive testing utilities:

```php
use Vampires\Sentinels\Facades\Sentinels;

class AgentTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_agent_processes_correctly()
    {
        // Use test helpers
        $context = $this->createTestContext('input');
        $agent = new MyAgent();
        
        $result = $agent($context);
        
        $this->assertEquals('expected', $result->payload);
        $this->assertTrue($result->hasMetadata('processed'));
    }
    
    public function test_with_fake_agents()
    {
        Sentinels::fake();
        
        Sentinels::process('input', MyAgent::class);
        
        Sentinels::assertAgentRan(MyAgent::class);
    }
}
```

## 🎚️ Configuration

Configure Sentinels in `config/sentinels.php`:

```php
return [
    'default_mode' => PipelineMode::Sequential,
    
    'agents' => [
        'discovery' => [
            'enabled' => true,
            'paths' => ['app/Agents', 'app/Pipelines'],
        ],
        'execution' => [
            'memory_limit' => '128M',
        ],
    ],
    
    'observability' => [
        'events' => ['enabled' => true],
        'metrics' => ['enabled' => true],
        'tracing' => ['enabled' => env('SENTINELS_TRACING', false)],
    ],
    
    // Uses the application's default Laravel queue connection.
    'async' => [
        'queue' => 'sentinels',
    ],
];
```

### Scenario-Based Decision Guide

| **Scenario** | **Use This** | **Why** | **Example** |
|-------------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Simple data transformation** | Laravel Pipeline | Minimal overhead, built-in | `$users->pipe(new FilterActive())->pipe(new FormatNames())` |
| **Background job processing** | Job Chains | Laravel native, good for simple async | `ProcessPayment::chain([SendEmail::class, UpdateStats::class])` |
| **System-wide event reactions** | Events/Listeners | Loose coupling, multiple handlers | `UserRegistered` → Email, Analytics, CRM sync |
| **Multi-step business workflows** | **Sentinels** | **Observability, error recovery** | **Order processing, content workflows** |
| **AI/ML processing pipelines** | **Sentinels** | **Context preservation, branching** | **LLM chains, image processing** |
| **Complex ETL operations** | **Sentinels** | **Conditional routing, monitoring** | **Data validation, enrichment, storage** |
| **API orchestration** | **Sentinels** | **Retry policies, correlation** | **Third-party integrations, webhooks** |
| **Content processing workflows** | **Sentinels** | **Dynamic routing, reusability** | **CMS publishing, media processing** |

### Choose Sentinels When You Need:

#### ✅ **Structured Multi-Step Processing**
```php
// When you have workflows like this:
$result = Sentinels::pipeline()
    ->pipe(new ValidateDataAgent())           // Step 1: Validate
    ->branch(                                 // Step 2: Conditional logic
        fn($ctx) => $ctx->hasTag('premium'),
        $premiumPipeline,                     // Premium user flow
        $standardPipeline                     // Standard user flow  
    )
    ->pipe(new AuditLogAgent())              // Step 3: Always audit
    ->through($userRequest);
```

#### ✅ **Rich Context & Correlation**
```php
// When you need to track data through complex flows:
$context = Context::create($orderData)
    ->withMetadata('user_id', $userId)
    ->withMetadata('request_id', $requestId)
    ->withTag('high-priority');

// Every agent can access and enrich this context
// Full traceability from start to finish
```

#### ✅ **Production-Grade Error Handling**
```php
// When failures must be graceful and recoverable:
$agent = new ExternalAPIAgent();
$agent->setRetryPolicy(RetryPolicy::exponential(
    attempts: 3,
    baseDelay: 1000,
    maxDelay: 30000
));

// Automatic retries with backoff
// Context preserved across retries
// Detailed error reporting
```

#### ✅ **Team Collaboration & Testing**
```php
// When multiple developers work on the same workflow:
class PaymentProcessingTest extends TestCase 
{
    public function test_payment_flow() 
    {
        Sentinels::fake();
        
        // Test just your agent in isolation
        $result = PaymentPipeline::process($orderContext);
        
        Sentinels::assertAgentRan(ValidateCardAgent::class);
        Sentinels::assertAgentRan(ChargePaymentAgent::class);
    }
}
```

### **Don't Use Sentinels When:**

❌ **Simple, one-step transformations** → Use Laravel Pipeline  
❌ **Fire-and-forget background jobs** → Use Job Chains  
❌ **System events with multiple listeners** → Use Events/Listeners  
❌ **Rapid prototyping** → Use simple Service classes  
❌ **Performance is critical over maintainability** → Use optimized custom solutions

## 🌟 Laravel Philosophy Alignment

Sentinels embraces Laravel's core philosophy while extending its capabilities for complex workflows:

### **"Developer Happiness First"**
Just like Laravel makes common tasks enjoyable, Sentinels makes complex workflows manageable:
```php
// Laravel's expressive syntax
User::where('active', true)->get();

// Sentinels' equally expressive pipelines
Sentinels::pipeline()
    ->pipe(new ValidateUserAgent())
    ->pipe(new ProcessUserAgent())
    ->through($userData);
```

### **"Convention Over Configuration"**
Sentinels follows Laravel's patterns, so everything feels familiar:
```php
// Generate an agent just like any Laravel component
php artisan make:agent ProcessOrderAgent

// Agents follow Laravel's naming conventions
app/Agents/ProcessOrderAgent.php     // Just like Controllers, Models, etc.
tests/Unit/ProcessOrderAgentTest.php // Standard test location
```

### **"Batteries Included"**
Like Laravel provides everything you need for web apps, Sentinels provides everything for workflows:
- **Artisan commands** for code generation
- **Testing utilities** that feel like Laravel's
- **Event system** integration out of the box  
- **Queue support** using Laravel workers, batch storage, and a shared cache; see [async setup](docs/pipelines.md#configuration)

### **"Progressive Disclosure"**
Start simple, add complexity only when needed:
```php
// Level 1: Simple agent execution
Sentinels::process($data, new MyAgent());

// Level 2: Basic pipeline
Sentinels::pipeline()
    ->pipe(new Agent1())
    ->pipe(new Agent2())
    ->through($data);

// Level 3: Advanced features when you need them
config(['sentinels.async.queue' => 'priority']);

Sentinels::pipeline()
    ->mode('parallel')
    ->async()
    ->pipe(new ComplexAgent())
    ->through($data);
```

### **"Testability as a First-Class Citizen"**
Testing Sentinels feels just like testing Laravel:
```php
class OrderPipelineTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_order_processing()
    {
        // Familiar Laravel testing patterns
        Sentinels::fake();
        
        // Process with confidence
        $result = OrderPipeline::process($order);
        
        // Laravel-style assertions
        Sentinels::assertAgentRan(ValidateOrderAgent::class);
        $this->assertTrue($result->isSuccessful());
    }
}
```

### **"Eloquent Relationships for Workflows"**
Just as Eloquent makes database relationships intuitive, Sentinels makes workflow relationships clear:
```php
// Laravel: Define model relationships
class Order extends Model {
    public function items() {
        return $this->hasMany(OrderItem::class);
    }
}

// Sentinels: Define workflow relationships
class OrderPipeline {
    public static function build() {
        return Pipeline::create()
            ->pipe(new ValidateOrderAgent())
            ->hasMany(ItemPipeline::class)  // Process each item
            ->pipe(new FinalizeOrderAgent());
    }
}
```

### **"The Laravel Way" Extended**
Sentinels doesn't replace Laravel patterns—it enhances them:

| Laravel Pattern | Sentinels Enhancement |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Service Providers | Agent discovery and registration |
| Facades | `Sentinels::` facade for clean syntax |
| Middleware | Agent middleware for cross-cutting concerns |
| Events | Pipeline events for observability |
| Jobs | Async agent execution |
| Validation | Context validation in agents |
| Container | Dependency injection in agents |

### **"Community-Driven Innovation"**
Like Laravel, Sentinels is designed to evolve with community needs:
- **Open architecture** for custom agent types
- **Extensible routing** strategies
- **Pluggable metrics** providers
- **Future community agent packages** support

```php
// Vision: Future community agents could work like Laravel packages
// composer require community/sentinels-ai-agents
// composer require community/sentinels-payment-agents

// The architecture supports this pattern:
Sentinels::pipeline()
    ->pipe(new YourCustomAgent())
    ->pipe(new AnotherCustomAgent())
    ->through($data);
```

**Sentinels is Laravel for workflows** - bringing the same joy, productivity, and elegance to complex processing that Laravel brings to web development.
